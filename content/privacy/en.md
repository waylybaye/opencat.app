# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 12, 2025**

## Introduction

OpenCat is a native AI client for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. This Privacy Policy explains how OpenCat handles your data, including how your information may be shared with third-party AI services when you use the app.

## How OpenCat Works

OpenCat is a native AI client that provides two ways to access AI services:

### OpenCat Cloud

OpenCat Cloud is a subscription service provided by us that gives you access to multiple AI models (including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others) through a single subscription. When you use OpenCat Cloud:

- Your messages are forwarded to the corresponding third-party AI service for processing.
- **We do not store, log, or retain any of your conversation content.** Your data passes through our service only for the purpose of routing it to the appropriate AI provider.
- We do not use your data for training, analytics, or any purpose other than delivering the AI response back to you.

### API Client Mode

OpenCat also functions as a standalone **API client** — you can configure your own API keys to connect directly to third-party AI services. In this mode:

- Your data is transmitted **directly from your device** to the third-party AI service you have configured.
- OpenCat does not route, intercept, or store any of your data — it acts purely as an interface between you and the service provider.
- You have full control over which providers you connect to.

## Information We Collect

### Analytics and Crash Data

We collect anonymous analytics and crash data to improve app performance and stability. This includes:

- App usage patterns (e.g., feature usage frequency)
- Device information (e.g., device model, OS version)
- Crash reports and diagnostic logs

This data is collected through Apple's built-in analytics framework and does not include your conversations or personal content.

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored locally on your device and is **not** collected or transmitted to our servers:

- API keys you configure for third-party services
- Conversation history and chat messages
- App preferences and settings
- Custom prompts and configurations

## Third-Party AI Services

### What Data Is Sent to Third-Party Services

When you interact with AI features in OpenCat, the following types of data may be sent to third-party AI services:

- **Text messages**: The messages you type and send in conversations
- **Images**: Photos or images you attach to your messages (for vision/multimodal features)
- **Audio/Voice**: Voice recordings when using speech-to-text or voice conversation features
- **Conversation context**: Previous messages in the current conversation thread, as needed to maintain context for AI responses

### OpenCat Cloud — Third-Party Data Sharing

When you use OpenCat Cloud, your data is sent from your device to our servers, then forwarded to the following third-party AI services for processing. **We do not store, log, or retain any of your conversation content** — data passes through our service solely for routing purposes.

| Service Provider | Services | Privacy Policy |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | GPT models, DALL-E, Whisper | [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) |
| Anthropic | Claude models | [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) |
| Google | Gemini models | [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| Microsoft Azure | Azure OpenAI, Text-to-Speech | [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek models | [Privacy Policy](https://www.deepseek.com/privacy) |

The specific AI service used depends on the model you select in the app. Each service processes your data according to its own privacy policy. We require that all third-party AI providers we integrate with provide equivalent or greater data protection as described in this policy.

### API Client Mode — Third-Party Data Sharing

When you use API Client mode, your data is sent **directly from your device** to the third-party AI service you have configured. OpenCat does not route, intercept, or have access to any of this data.

You may connect to any of the following services, or any other OpenAI-compatible API provider:

| Service Provider | Services | Privacy Policy |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | GPT models, DALL-E, Whisper | [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) |
| Anthropic | Claude models | [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) |
| Google | Gemini models | [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| Microsoft Azure | Azure OpenAI, Text-to-Speech | [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) |
| Z-AI (Zhipu AI) | GLM models | [Privacy Policy](https://www.zhipuai.cn/privacy) |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek models | [Privacy Policy](https://www.deepseek.com/privacy) |
| Other providers | Any OpenAI-compatible API service | Refer to the provider's privacy policy |

In this mode, you are responsible for reviewing and accepting the privacy policy of each service you configure. OpenCat has no visibility into the data exchanged between your device and the provider.

### Your Control Over Data Sharing

- **You choose your mode**: You can use OpenCat Cloud for convenience or configure your own API keys for direct access.
- **You decide which services to use**: Whether through OpenCat Cloud or API Client mode, you choose which AI services to interact with.
- **You control what you send**: Data is only transmitted when you actively send a message or use a feature that requires AI processing.
- **You can disconnect at any time**: You can remove any API key or cancel your OpenCat Cloud subscription at any time to stop data from being sent to third-party services.
- **No default connections**: In API Client mode, OpenCat does not connect to any third-party AI service until you configure it.

### Data Transmission Security

All data transmitted between OpenCat and third-party AI services is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols. In API Client mode, your content goes directly from your device to the configured service provider. In OpenCat Cloud mode, data is encrypted in transit to our servers and then forwarded to the AI provider — we do not store or log any of your content at any point.

## How We Protect Your Information

We take appropriate security measures to protect your information:

- API keys and sensitive data are stored securely in your device's keychain
- All network communications use encrypted HTTPS/TLS connections
- Conversation data is stored locally on your device
- We do not maintain servers that process or store your conversations

## Children's Privacy

OpenCat is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the app, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
